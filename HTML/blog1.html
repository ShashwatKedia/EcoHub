                Plastic pollution could trigger $20 billion in lawsuit payouts, says report.

                The $20 billion figure is an order of magnitude smaller than losses the insurance industry has suffered from asbestos-related lawsuits. Credit ratings agency AM Best estimates these at $146 billion, but incurred over decades rather than from the first eight years of claims. Still, the report warns that plastics-related losses could ultimately be comparable in size.
                <br><br>
                Minderoo enlisted law firm Clyde & Co together with data group Praedicat to calculate the figure by tracing the value of environmental and human health damage, which is estimated to be hundreds of billions of dollars, through the existing legal avenues claimants could take to get compensation. Praedicat’s models attached probabilities to successful claims over the effect of chemicals found in plastics.
                <br><br>
                Some research has linked chemical additives in plastics to health problems such as infertility, early puberty, developmental issues and metabolic disorders. The report estimates that the global social costs associated with these plastic-related chemicals exceeds $100 billion a year. Using relevant legal precedents including some judgments in the recent opioids lawsuits, the researchers calculated expected liabilities of $20 billion in the US.

                Future Costs
            </div>
            <div class="blog_para">
                The large gap between the estimated social cost of plastic pollution and the more than $20 billion corporate liabilities is partly explained by the relative infancy of plastics litigation and test cases, and the difficulty of linking harms to particular producers of plastic. Its supply chains include many actors and unlike with tobacco lawsuits, for example, most people have been exposed to polymers.
                <br><br>
                Underwriters and risk managers create models to simulate the real world and predict the likelihood of different future outcomes. The report estimates that insurers would need to account for the worst case scenario of losses of $100 billion when planning for how much capital they need to hold. But the gap may narrow in the future as case law builds. There is a possibility of a large uptick in successful claims in the medium term, the report says.
                <br><br>
                The insurance and reinsurance industry make decisions with longer time horizons than investors and companies because they are calculating their exposures to future claims.
            
                “In 10 years time the legal cases might be far stronger, the science far more damning,” said Dominic Charles, director at the Minderoo Foundation.
