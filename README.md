Ecohub is a not-for profit organisation working towards saving the environment and ensuring a better future for our planet. Our mission is to raise awareness about the ongoing ecological catastrophes, connect people with organisations doing the groundwork required to help the environment, promote sustainable practices, connect with users and help them out in any way possible.
        Ecohub has collaborated with major foundations and companies such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, IBM, and Wipro to ensure reaching the community globally. Closely working with many industries, we have managed to reduce carbon emissions of industrial infrastructure by up to 15%
        Ecohub was founded on the basic moral principles of giving back. Nature and the environment provide us with all the necessities and luxuries that we so often take for granted and it is about time we start giving back. Through our initiatives, we aim to build a more sustainable future in this beautiful planet we call home.
